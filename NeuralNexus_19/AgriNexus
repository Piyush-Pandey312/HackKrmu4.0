🌱 AgriNexus - AI-Powered Smart Agriculture 🌾
Team Name - Neural Nexus
🚀 Submitted for Hack KRMU 4.0 | Hackathon (Round 2)
AgriNexus is an AI-driven smart agriculture platform designed to assist farmers in diagnosing plant diseases, predicting crop yields, and providing treatment recommendations. Our system integrates deep learning (CNN models) with an interactive React-based frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MySQL database connectivity. The platform also supports offline functionalities to ensure accessibility in remote agricultural areas.

📌 Key Features
✅ Plant Disease Detection – Uses CNN models trained on PlantVillage dataset to identify diseases.
✅ Flower & Crop Classification – Employs deep learning models trained on Flower dataset.
✅ AI-Powered Treatment Recommendations – Provides disease-specific solutions.
✅ User-Friendly UI – Designed with Figma & developed using React.
✅ Fast & Scalable Backend – Built with FastAPI & MySQL for real-time responses.
✅ Offline Mode – Supports functionality without an internet connection.

🛠️ Project Structure
1️⃣ Machine Learning Models (Python & TensorFlow)
Datasets: PlantVillage (crop diseases) & Flower (plant classification).
CNN Models: Trained and saved in .h5 format.
2️⃣ UI/UX (Figma & React)
Pintu designed all UI screens in Figma.
Pradeep developed the frontend using React, implementing each UI module separately.
3️⃣ Backend & Database (FastAPI & MySQL)
Himanshu developed the backend API using FastAPI (Python).
Database: Connected with MySQL (pymysql library).
4️⃣ Deployment & Offline Mode
App is deployed with offline functionalities, ensuring usability in low-network regions.
